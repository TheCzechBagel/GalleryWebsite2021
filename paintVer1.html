    <p class="description">These aren't meant to be good or even make much sense on their own.

    <p class="description">Everyone has heard the phrase "let sleeping dogs lie", but how do you follow this law of life when said dog is taking up your position on the bed? The easiest and most obvious solution is an orbital drop with a parachute. By landing with your limbs around the dog [careful not to land directly on top of it] you can enjoy a peaceful night's rest while still following the greatest rule of modern society.</p>

    <p class="description">It's important that everyone has a good kick every now and them to remind themselves of where they are.
